# github-users-app
This project is a simple React Native app for listing contributors of repositories.

## Setup
If you have not global react-native-cli you can install with running ``npm i -g react-native-cli`` command.

If you are on a Mac you should install watchman. Run ``brew install watchman``

You should run ``npm install`` or ``yarn`` commands for installing dependencies.

## Running Project

### For IOS

If you have Xcode on your Mac you can easily run ``react-native run-ios``. Simulator will be open after build.

### For Android

First of all, you should install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). 
After that you have to read official [React Native - Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page. After setting up your computer you can run ``react-native run-android`` command.

If everything goes well you can see the application on simulator.

Important: You should add your personal Github Token in ``app/config.js``
